    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Gnocchi are an Italian type of pasta, with potato gnocchi being the most common variety. 
        They have a light, pillowy texture and are typically boiled and served with a variety of sauces, 
        such as tomato, pesto, or butter and sage.
    </p>
    <p>The name 'gnocchi' comes from the Italian word nocchio, meaning 'knot' or 'lump'.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 medium russet potatoes, scrubbed</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Cook the Potatoes:</strong> Place the <em>scrubbed</em> potatoes in a large saucepan and cover them with 
            <em>2 inches of salted water</em>. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce to medium-high and 
            simmer until <em>fork-tender but still firm</em>, about 25 to 30 minutes. Drain and return the 
            potatoes to the pot to <em>dry</em> for 5 to 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Peel and Mash:</strong> Once <em>cool enough to handle</em>, rub off the skins with your hands. Pass the 
            <em>peeled</em> potatoes through a <em>potato ricer</em> into a large bowl (<em>or mash until completely smooth</em>). 
            Let cool slightly for about 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Make the Dough:</strong> Gently <em>fold in</em> the <em>flour, egg, and salt</em> until just combined. 
            Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and knead briefly, about 1 to 2 times, 
            until <em>smooth but not overworked</em>.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Shape the Gnocchi</strong>: Divide the dough into 4 equal portions. Roll each portion into a 
            <em>¾-inch thick rope</em>. Cut into <em>½-inch pieces</em>. (<em>Optional:</em> Roll each piece over the tines of a fork or 
            a gnocchi board for ridges.) Place the gnocchi on a <em>floured, parchment-lined baking sheet</em> 
            in a single layer.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Cook the Gnocchi:</strong> Bring a <em>large pot of salted water</em> to a boil. Working in batches, drop in 
            the gnocchi and cook for 3 to 4 minutes, or until they <em>float to the surface</em>. Use a 
            <em>slotted spoon</em> or <em>spider</em> to transfer them directly to your <em>desired sauce</em>.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Serve and Enjoy!</strong> Toss with your favorite sauce—such as <em>tomato, pesto, or butter and 
            sage</em>—and serve immediately.
        </li>
    </ol>
