    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Cheesecake is a rich, creamy dessert made from a smooth mixture of cream cheese, eggs, and 
        sugar, typically set on a crust of crushed cookies or graham crackers. It can be either 
        baked or no-bake, with variations ranging from the classic New York-style to fruit-topped, 
        chocolate, or unique flavors like matcha and caramel.

        remains a popular dessert worldwide.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ¾ cups Honey Maid graham cracker crumbs</li>
        <li>⅓ cup butter, melted</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups sugar, divided</li>
        <li>3 (8-ounce) packages Philadelphia cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>1 cup Breakstone's or Knudsen sour cream</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 (21-ounce) can cherry pie filling</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C).</strong></li>
        <li>
            <strong>Prepare the crust:</strong> In a large bowl, mix the graham cracker crumbs, melted butter, and 
            <em>¼ cup sugar</em> until well combined. Press the mixture firmly into the bottom of a 
            <em>9-inch springform pan</em>.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Make the filling:</strong> In a separate large bowl, beat the cream cheese and the remaining sugar 
            with a mixer until smooth and well blended. Add the sour cream and vanilla extract, 
            mixing until fully incorporated.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Add the eggs:</strong> Beat in the eggs one at a time, mixing on low speed just until 
            combined—avoid overmixing.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Assemble and bake:</strong> Pour the cheesecake mixture over the prepared crust. Bake in the preheated 
            oven for <em>1 hour to 1 hour 10 minutes</em>, or until the center is almost set.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Cool and refrigerate:</strong> Run a knife around the rim of the pan to loosen the cheesecake. 
            Let it cool completely before removing the pan’s rim. Refrigerate for at least <em>4 hours</em> 
            to set.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Top with cherry pie filling before serving. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
